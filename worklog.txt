List of things to work on:
- Add major crops to state tooltips
- add overlap/separate functionality (path line and regression line)
- possibly add more legend stuff for map to show colors for negative change/add line graph legend
- make line graph regression lines not ugly 
    -> %DONE%
- any other weird html bugs you notice

Move the task to your name if you are working on it.
Alex: - overlapping/separation
Brooke:
Kevin: - handle negatives in the tooltip with "bees gained" instead of "negative bees lost"
